# Math Animations
Some ready to go animations for you to make your own Statistical, Mathematical or ML animations.
This gif was made with the following code using Tensorflow v1, Matplotlib, sklearn and Celluloid
```import LinearRegressionAnimation
ling = LinearRegressionAnimation()
animation = ling.animate()
animation.save("Linear_Regression.gif")```
